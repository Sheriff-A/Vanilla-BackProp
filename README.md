# Vanilla-BackProp
From Scratch Image Classification Project using Back Propagation and Gradient Descent

This Project is for the purpose of demonstrating an understanding of the processes that goes on in a simple multi-layer perceptron neural network.
It also breaks down the data flow of the learning algorithms involved and show how the network tweaks itself toward becoming a learned model.
